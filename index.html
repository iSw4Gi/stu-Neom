Neom is a planned smart city in Tabuk Province in northwestern Saudi Arabia.
The site is north of the Red Sea, east of Egypt across the Gulf of Aqaba, 
and south of Jordan. The total area of Neom is 26,500 km²


Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced on Tuesday that the "NEOM" economic zone is likely to be offered for subscription during 2024.
Construction work has begun for Neum, a business district in Tabuk Governorate, aimed at diversifying the economy of the world's largest oil exporter.
The Saudi crown prince said: “NEOM will add (through the offering process) one trillion riyals ($266 billion) to the size of the Saudi stock market.
 No less than 1.2 trillion riyals at the beginning, with the total exceeding 5 trillion after the project is completed.”

He added that the cost of the first phase of the region will come from the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund.
The Public Investment Fund is the main investor in the "NEOM" region, which is a project that uses advanced technologies and is located on an area 
of ​26,500 square kilometers on the Red Sea, and includes a number of regions, including industrial and logistical regions, and is scheduled to be completed in 2025.
